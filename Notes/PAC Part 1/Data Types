- "Reserved Words" make Ruby do something else besides evaluate an expression. An example of reserved words would be "def", "if", "varchar", or "for".
- "Data" is defined as the constants or values.
- There are 5 "Scalar" (things that could be put on a scale) data types:
  + "Integer"
  + "Float"
  + "Boolean"
  + "String"
  + "Symbol"
- Identify an "Integer": Whole Numbers such as "-1, 0, 1, ..."
- Identify a "Float": Decimals Number such as "-1.5, 0.5, ..."
- Identify "Boolean" Values: To use these in Ruby expressions, you just type in "true" or "false"
- Identify "String" Values: You create Strings by surrounding text in "" or ''.
- Identify "Symbol" Values:  It's like a plain old "bare word" (human understandable), but with a ":" in front. It looks like ":i_am_a_symbol".
- You can ask IRB for the data type of a value by adding ".class" at the end. An example: "10.class" would return "Integer".
