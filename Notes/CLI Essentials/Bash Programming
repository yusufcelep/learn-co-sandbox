- View file contents with the command "cat" and "open". An example: "cat [filename]", this action prints the content to your command line. The "open" command is only avialable on the Mac OSX. This command runs the "Default Action" so for example, if you are on a program such as Google Chrome and type open, Google Chrome would open. Using this command on files would open the file in a window.
- Print text with the command "echo". This command takes a String (text) and prints it to the screen. An example: "echo 'Hi world'" would return "Hi World". You can also redirect text into a file, this means you can add text into a file without having to open it. You can do this action with the command ">>", an example: "echo "I'm printing to the screen" >> [filename]". However, be careful, using just one ">" will overwrite the file, this means the file would only contain whatever you just typed, all the previous text would be deleted.
- An "Environment Variable" is a variable which can be configured to change the way the shell works and used by multiple applications or processes. This means that we can customize our "shell" or "terminal" to do many things like show colors, always show hidden files, and etc.
- "PATH" is a shortcut into specific directories, it contains certain words like "tools" or "ruby" and you won't have to type "cd" before the desired location to access these directories. One may simply just type "ruby" and will find themselves in the ruby directory. You can view your current "PATH" with the command "echo $PATH". To view the current version of whatever you may need to access, you will need to add "-v" to the end of your code.
- Look up bash documentation with the command "man", this is short for "Manual". ITs as the name implies, a manual on how to use bash. After using the manual, you will notice that your command prompt has disappeared, to fix this, enter "$ q" which means "Quit".
